[Signum Framework](http://www.signumframework.com/)
===================================================

Signum Framework is the new Open Source framework from Signum Software for writing data-centric applications over the latest Microsoft technologies: .Net 4.0, C# 5.0, WPF, ASP.Net MVC 3.0 (Razor) and Typescript. 

The main focus of the framework is being able to write vertical modules (database tables, entities, logic and Win / Web user interface) that can be shared between projects

It provides a consistent model for N-layer architectures by moving the entities to the very centre of your solution using Signum.Entities.

Our cutting-edge ORM, Signum.Engine, has one of the first full LINQ Providers implemented outside Microsoft offices.

Signum.Windows dramatically simplifies giving a WPF user interface to your entities. 

Also Signum.Web does the same using ASP.Net MVC 3.0 / Razor / jQuery / Bootstrap and TypeScript

### Main Features ###
* Designed for vertical modules (Bounded Context in DDD jargon)
* Entities-first approach
* ORM with a full LINQ Provider
* Unified validation
* Schema generation (and sync)
* WPF smart-client interface
* ASP.Net MVC 4.0 Razor


### Principles ###
* Promote simple and clean code, avoiding astronautical architectures
* Favour compile-time checked C# over error-prone XML configurations
* Create a solid foundation for the integration of application modules (on schema, BL and UI code)
* Encourage a more functional way of programming
* Avoid code duplication at any cost
* Be a good citizen wherever we are (.Net, LINQ, WPF, ASP.Net MVC) following common practices and conventions
